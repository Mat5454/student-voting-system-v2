A student voting app lets schools run secure, campus-wide decisions—from student council or club officer elections to referendums on policies, budget allocations, event choices, course preferences, awards, and quick opinion polls. Good apps verify eligibility (SSO/student email), support multiple ballot types (single-choice, ranked-choice/IRV, approval), enforce one-vote-per-student with optional anonymity, and keep audit trails for transparency. They’re mobile-friendly, send deadline reminders, and provide clear turnout and results reporting (with exports) so decisions are fair, accessible, and easy to manage.
